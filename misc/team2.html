<b><u>Ethics Of The Flipped Classroom.</b></u>
<p>
Some researchers see the flipped classroom as a paradigm shift while others are more cautious and believe more research is needed. 
I’m in the cautious camp because even though this model of teaching has been around for around a decade, there is little empirical evidence that it improves student performance and grades. 
Teachers and students alike predominantly show a preference for the flipped model over the traditional classroom, but there are students that strongly dislike it and are having trouble adjusting to this model. 
Economically disadvantaged may struggle due to their less than ideal home study environment. There also hasn’t been enough research on how this will impact foreign student, student from different cultures and students with disabilities. Furthermore, 
student that are not comfortable with technology may find this this type of learning challenging when things do not work. These are issues that need further investigation before we implement such a resolutory change in our education system. 
The other concern I have is that this will substantially increase young student’s screen time, causing adverse effects on their physical and mental health.<p>
