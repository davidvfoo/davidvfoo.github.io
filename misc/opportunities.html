<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
</ul><h4><p>Opportunities Of The Flipped Classroom.<p></h4>

<p>
Numerous researches have demonstrated that the flipped classroom increases student’s grades and motivation, Graham Brent Johnson (2013). Furthermore, 
this method has shown to have beneficial impact on problem solving and application skills, self-efficacy, critical thinking, attendance, perception and attitude, B Aydin, V Demirer, (2016).<p>

<p>
Bergmann and Sams (2012) who are credited with the introduction of the Flipped Classroom, argue that this method of education speaks the language of today’s students. 
These students are familiar with online technology and are used to pausing and rewinding video content to better understand it’s message. 
It also allows teacher, through more interaction with their student, to know them better, and assist those that are struggling. <p>

<p>
Researchers Mason et al. (2013) have also stated some of the advantages of this method. Student initially found the flipped classroom unfamiliar but quickly adapted and found it to be very effective. 
Their performance on quizzes and open-ended design exercises improved. As a bonus, more content was able to be covered by the educator. When compared to the traditional classroom, advantages observed by (Chen et al.), cost effectiveness, 
student could consume the content wherever and whenever, reduced travel time, interacting with high quality video presentations and the ease of content distribution. 
Nguyen (2015) states there is research showing that potentially online learning is at least as effective as traditional learning. <p>

<b><u>Better engagement</b></u> 
<p>
Adams et al. (2011) argues that flipping the classroom improves the learning environment while keeping the students more engaged in the content. Salamonson et al. 
(2009) proposed that the flipped classroom model lead to more engaged students, which in turn had a positive effect on academic performance. Hamden et al. 
(2013) claim that student’s critical thinking and participation have increased under the flipped classroom method. This is mainly due students coming to class with better understanding of a topic and able to participate and interact in the classroom. 
Tucker (2021) concurs that the biggest benefit of this model is the student’s increased engagement in the syllabus content. 
Fulton(2013) see an advantage of this model being the ability to spot weakness in student’s understanding of specific concepts and tailor material allowing more effective one-on-one sessions with students. <p>  

<b><u>More Flexibility</b></u> 
<p>
Steed (2012) argues that the ability to rewind and view lectures many times is very beneficial to slower learners. 
This increased understanding of the content means they are more attentive in class where practical and group activities are performed. 
Fulton (2013) states that the flipped classroom has the added flexibility of allowed learning to take place even when students or teachers are unable to attend. 
Brunsell and Horejsi (2013) points out that it has given students the freedom to learn at their own pace. Du et al. 
(2014) concur that this method gave students a sense of control over where and when their learning took place. <p>
