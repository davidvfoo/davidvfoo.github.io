<b><u>Ethics Of The Flipped Classroom. </b></u>
<p>
In today's modern learning environment I believe there is a place for the flipped learning model to be utilized successfully however, this model would not work on a large scale within the learning world because of the many risks. 
The primary risk that concerns me within the model is the lack of infrastructure, this models’ success is dependent on the students having both an internet connection and a constant access to technology that is good enough to watch 
the videos provided this being a problem is uncommon but does happen in today's technology prevalent age but in the third world countries there is very little resources meaning this model would never be able to take off or would 
cause a disparity in access to education between students based on outside factors like wealth. Another concern I have with this model is the fact that all humans learn differently, 
for some people this model would work very well provided the content is made satisfactory and this learning method suits the way they learn. 
If the material provided to the student is unsatisfactory or if they cannot understand the content being taught the in person sessions/class time will be less effective then the currently implemented model.<p>

<p>
Overall I recommend using the flipped learning method sparingly until proven further. The topic has interesting talking points within it while also being specific enough to easily research allowing for a deeper conversation/understanding, 
this impacted our research positively as we were interested in the topic. Personally I found our research to be comprehensive and well focused on the topic as a whole because
 if we go too specific there wouldn't be enough information there as the implementation/testing has been limited on flipped learning and if we went too broad our topic wouldn't feel like a topic/substantial. 
 I think we could have had a bit more focus on students’ and teachers' perspective on the learning model instead of just the fundamentals and raw idea.
 I wish we could see more of the personal aspects that are critical to the models’ success. <p>
