<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Risks Of The Flipped Classroom.<p></h4>
<p>
Implementing is not without challenges. Some of these challenges will be highlighted here. Enfield (2013) warns that producing videos of the required standard will very time consuming. 
Students are more forgiving of mistakes and re-phrasing in classroom environment but expect everything to be perfectly edit and free of all errors. 
This places pressure on those creating video content to ensure they are free of errors. The technology used must also be robust enough that the videos are of a high enough resolution and without lag. 
Poor quality video will only confuse students and they will not be prepared for the classroom tasks Miller (2012). <p>

<p>There is the risk that the reliance on online access for the flipped model to work could widen the digital gap and further penalise economically disadvantaged students Du et al. (2014). <p>  

<p>
Getting the teaching staff to change their teaching styles away from the traditional methods to a flipped classroom model will take a considerable amount of time and training (Enfield 2013). 
While most students had a positive perception of the flipped classroom, a few students “strongly disliked” the model, Bishop and Verleger (2013). 
Typical flipped classrooms rely heavily on asynchronous e-learning which gives this model it’s flexibility. 
However, an over reliance on this form of asynchronous activity can make students feel isolated and affect their collaborative learning skills Hrastinski (2008). 
It’s therefore important to include some form of interaction in the online e-learning to keep the students motivated and focused. <p>

<p>
This form of learning is more successful with student who have a combination of good IT and time-management skills. These are generally disciplined student with good study habits Eriksson et al. (2017); Krasnzow (2013). 
Student who fail to watch the online content before coming to class can cause problem for the teachers having to deal with two distinct groups working at stages in class work. <p> 

<p>
The transition stage from traditional to flipped classroom model will require teachers and students to recognise that a change in approach and habits to learning are adopted so that grades are not adversely affected. <p>
