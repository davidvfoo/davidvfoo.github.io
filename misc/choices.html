<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

</ul><h4><p>Choices Of The Flipped Classroom.<p></h4>

<p>
Recent research advocates some strategies for implementing the flipped classroom successfully. Milman (2012) found that “formative and summative assessments” were needed to supplement the classroom activities. 
In order to motivate the student to view the video content, Enfield (2013) recommends adding quizzes to the online content. Miller (2012) advocates a slightly different but similar approach with game-based and project-based learning. 
Engaging the student in their learning is important to achieving a greater level of understanding and retention.
Miller also recommends some form of reflective activity after viewing videos to internalise the knowledge and form connections between the content.<p> 

<b><u>Transactional Distance and The Flipped Classroom </b></u> 

<p>
Moore (1993) referred to Transactional Distance (TD) as “psychological and communication space to be crossed, a space for potential misunderstanding between the inputs of the instructor and those of the learner”.
Moore explains that if the student is not engaged and motivated to be an active learner then the TD is large. 
This can happen, not just with online content but in the traditional classroom too. 
Conversely if the teacher can motivate and engage students with interesting and challenging content to be active learners responsible for their own learning then the TD shrinks resulting in a boost in learning, Moore (1984). 
TD needs to be reduced to an absolute minimum for this model to be effective. Moore (1993) identifies three components to consider when examining TD in a learning environment: <b>Structure</b>, <b>Dialogue</b> and <b>Learner autonomy</b>. 

<p>
<b>Structure</b> refers to the rigidity or flexibility of the course, where there is little if any interaction between the teacher and the student during lectures or the online activity. 
Moore notes that as Structure increases so does TD, resulting to less engaged students. <p>

<p>
<b>Dialogue</b> refers to the calibre of the communication between the students and the teacher, where a high standard of interaction is exchanged.
 Moore asserts that there is an inverse relationship between Dialogue and TD.<p>
 
<p>
<b>Learner autonomy</b>  refers to the degree of autonomy the student has to exercise in that student/teacher relationship with regards to their learning goals and objectives. 
Typically, in situations where structure is high and dialogue is low, the learner tends to compensate with higher autonomy leading to greater TD.<p>

<p>The level of TD in a flipped classroom model needs to be monitored carefully. What is acceptable will depend on the type of learners and their ability to handle autonomy. <p>

<b><u>Technology Available for Creating Video Content </b></u> 
<p>
In order to effectively implement the flipped classroom model, various technologies were introduced to assist teachers who wanted to use the model. 
These materials are evaluated according to their compatibility with mobile devices and studied between the years 2010 and 2015. Veysel Demirer (2016). Table 1 below shows the results: <p>

<br>We’ll be looking at two of the categories in the table: Content Preparation and Content Sharing.
<br></br>
<b><u>Content Preparation: </b></u> 
<p>
Bergmann and Sams (2014) emphasised that high quality audio and video was important in distributing content online. Here are some of the tools that are available for creating those videos: <p>

<p>
<b>Adobe Captivate</b> which allows the conversion of Microsoft Powerpoint slides to HTML content and the creation of quizzes is a favourite with trainers. <p>

<p>
<b>Screencast-O-Matic</b> allows the creation of short videos of up to 15 minutes long for free. 
It does not require any installation and is very user friendly. As Bergmann and Sams (2014) recommends short videos, this solution should more than do the job.<p> 

<p>
<b>PDF Converters</b> are very handy for files that need to be unloaded to an online platform in a PDF format.<p> 

<p>
<b>Showme</b> according to the marketing on their website “turns your iPad into a personal interactive whiteboard allowing you to easily record voice-over lessons and share them…” <b>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b><u>Content Sharing: </b></u> 
<p>
YouTube</b> is an online video sharing platform the has millions of videos and users can add their own. I ideal platform for teachers to post their videos and direct their student to videos that are already there.<p> 

<p>
<b>Blackboard</b> is an online customisable learning environment that allows teachers to manage their courses and share course content with students, and for students to share and submit content. <p>

<p>
<b>Moodle</b> is a powerful, free, open source learning management system serving more than 200,000,000 users around the world.  It helps teachers eLearning and online courses. <p>

<p>
<b>Google Docs</b> is a free, feature rich Web-based application in which documents and spreadsheets can be created, edited. It even provides storage to store your files. <p>
